# InsightRAG
InsightRAG is an autonomous survey analysis agent that combines RAG with statistical tool-use to interpret datasets, generate insights, and produce theory-grounded explanations. It retrieves context from questionnaires and academic literature, runs analyses, and delivers clear, accurate, and actionable results.

InsightRAG is an autonomous survey-analysis system that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with agentic reasoning to perform end-to-end analytical tasks. Instead of simply answering questions, InsightRAG reads and understands survey questionnaires, codebooks, and theoretical documents by indexing them into a vector database. When users ask analytical questions, the system retrieves the most relevant contextual information—such as variable definitions, measurement scales, or theoretical frameworks—and uses it to guide both the statistical approach and the interpretive logic behind its conclusions.

Beyond retrieval, InsightRAG employs tool-use agents capable of performing real data analysis. The system loads survey datasets, computes descriptive statistics, runs inferential tests (t-tests, ANOVA, correlations, regressions), and generates visualizations. After executing the statistical procedures through Python-based tools, the agent evaluates the numerical results and synthesizes them with retrieved theoretical context. This allows InsightRAG to produce academically grounded interpretations that explain not only what the data shows, but why those patterns may exist based on established literature or conceptual frameworks such as institutional theory, social acceptance models, or the MLP perspective.

The final output is a structured, human-quality analytical report written in natural academic style. InsightRAG generates explanations, insights, and implications that resemble expert-level reasoning—making it useful for students, researchers, and professionals who need rapid, reliable interpretation of survey data. Its combination of autonomous planning, dynamic tool use, and theory-aware RAG retrieval positions InsightRAG as a next-generation research copilot, capable of transforming raw data into meaningful knowledge with minimal human input.
